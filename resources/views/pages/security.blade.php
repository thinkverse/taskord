                        <div>Do not test vulnerabilities in public. We ask that you do not attempt any vulnerabilities, rate-limiting tests, exploits, or any other security/bug-related findings if it will impact another community member. This means you should not leave comments on someone else’s tasks and questions, or otherwise, impact their experience on the platform.</div>
                        <div class="mt-1">Note that we are open source and have <a href="https://gitlab.com/taskord/taskord/-/blob/main/docs/installation.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> available if you're interested in setting up a dev environment for the purposes of testing.</div>

                         Do not report similar issues or variations of the same issue in different reports. Please report any similar issues in a single report. It's better for both parties to have this information in one place where we can evaluate it all together. Please note any and all areas where your vulnerability might be relevant. You will not be penalized or receive a lower reward for streamlining your report in one place vs. spreading it across different areas.

                        DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities should not be tested for more than a span of 5 minutes. Be courteous and reasonable when testing any endpoints on dev.to as this may interfere with our monitoring. If we discover that you are testing DoS disruptively for prolonged periods of time, we may restrict your award, block your IP address, or remove your eligibility to participate in the program.

                        Please be patient with us after sending in your report. We’d appreciate it if you avoid messaging us to ask about the status of your report. Our team will get back to you as quickly as we are able. It is okay to inquire about the status of your report if you haven’t heard from us 2 weeks after sending it in. Otherwise, we ask that you please wait patiently for us to contact you, unless you have more information relevant to the vulnerability that you’d like to share.
